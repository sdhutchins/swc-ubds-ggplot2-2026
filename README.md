# teaching-template

A lightweight repository template for organizing materials for workshops, tutorials, and teaching sessions.

This template structures a single repo around four areas: **docs**, **code**, **data**, and **handouts**. Use one repository per workshop or topic; clone or copy this template as a starting point.

It is not a curriculum, lesson plan, or software project. There is no prescribed order or pedagogy; add whatever materials fit the session.

## Contents

- **docs/** — Slide decks, documentation, or similar presentation files
- **code/** — Example scripts, notebooks, or snippets used in the session
- **data/** — Sample or demo datasets
- **handouts/** — Reference sheets, cheat sheets, or printable handouts

Each folder has a short README describing what belongs there.
